If I remember correctly, there are holes in the backplate. And the mirror should be hung or screwed on using those holes. I believe it should be fairly easy to do — the mirror is made of several parts, and first the back panel is mounted, then the frame with the mirror glass is attached.
I really hope I could be of help.

Thanks for your question.  This mirror is made upon order at the Island of Murano, Italy.  It will take 4-6 weeks to be created and shipped to your address.  It is hand made using the finest glass of Murano and each piece is carefully crafted.  I can only give you an approximate price, since there is some uncertainty of how much the tariff will be.  I usually offer this piece for $9,900 and can even do a little better than that to the trade, but I will have to nail down an exact cost to be sure.  Let me know if that fits your budget and if it does, I will give you an absolute price.  By the way, it's a nice size: 49" x 30".  Thanks again,

I just wanted to circle back to see where things landed on your end with the Luigi Tiengo sofa. Totally understand that projects shift and timelines evolve. I just figured I’d check in to see if it’s still under consideration or if you’ve found something that better fits the direction you're heading.

No pressure at all  but if you’re still interested or considering an offer, I’m happy to revisit details, provide any additional info, or answer questions that might help with the decision.

Hope all is well and that your project is coming together beautifully!

Thank you for your enquiry. The price of the turquoise mushroom by Emma Donnersberg is £ 3,500 and the trade price is £ 3150 (including VAT on the margin scheme). We don't currently have one in stock but can of course commission a new one. We'd simply need to check the lead time with Emma because workshops often close for the summer holidays.

Below is more information about the artist and the work.
With best wishes,
Erik

Well-known as a Western-style watercolorist, Aida Naohiko here adopts Japanese conventions and a vertical East-Asian format to depict a series of twelve charming, delicate, and atmospheric landscape subjects, each of them related to a particular month of the year and labeled with a cartouche in the form of two overlapping squares of Japanese paper. Some paintings in the series recall the work of painters in the neo-Rinpa style pioneered by Kyoto-based artist and art director Kamisaka Sekka (1866–1942).

Born in Aizu-Wakamatsu, some 200 miles north of Tokyo, Aida Naohiko (known early in his career as Torahiko 寅彦) exhibited regularly at the Bunten official national salon and its successors from 1909 until 1943, eventually reaching mukansa status (free from the  requirement to submit his work for selection) and serving as a jury member. He was a member or founder-member of several leading associations devoted to watercolors or Western-style painting, including the Nihon Suisaigakai, the Hakujitsukai, the Hakubakai, and the Taiheiyōgakai.

The twelve scenes are as follows, from right to left:
First Month: Sunrise on New Year’s Day
Second Month: Mountain Home in the Snow
Third Month: Plum-Blossom Village
Fourth Month: Cherry Blossom in the Mountains
Fifth Month: In the Willow's Shade
Sixth Month: The Scent of Flowers
Seventh Month: Evening Cool
Eighth Month: Waterfall Deep in the Mountains
Ninth Month: Rainstorm
Tenth Month: Evening Moon
Eleventh Month: Pasture
Twelfth Month: Withered Grasses in the Mountains

You have discovered my marvelous Daniel and Josh. I have worked with Daniel for 20 years.  As I told you, the rug is stored with him in Poway. The tiebacks and the bronze panels are at my home where he coud retrieve them should we make a deal.
The backs of the panels are unfinished, hence another reason to mont and frame them as doors. For a wall feature, they could simply be hung.
I would include the handles for you. They are impressive.  Bronze and bakelite, I believe.
My best price with the inclusion of the handles is $13,000.
I hope you have been able to peruse the cabinetmanker's drawings. The dimensions are exact.
They are securely in a cardboard carton. I would trust Daniel to assess if that is adequate for transport safely to you.
Regards, Mary
