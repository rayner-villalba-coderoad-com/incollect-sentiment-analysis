Thank you for your enquiry. 
The ex VAT. trade price for the five seater Molecule bench by Timothy Schreiber is  £30,000 and we have one available with us so an October shipping would be possible.

The bench can absolutely be used outdoors as it is solid cast bronze. It normally comes unsealed but for outdoor use,  we recommend regular application of a protective layer of wax so it slows down the natural patination.  

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.

Thank you for your message!
Yes, we can absolutely produce the console in a custom size and with a different stone top. We also offer the option to deliver the console without a stone top, allowing you to source and install a stone that best suits your client's preferences.
We’d be happy to suggest Samba Brown Stone, a beautiful and richly toned stone that complements the console design very well. I’m attaching an image of the stone for your reference. Please feel free to let us know your preferences or any specific stone type or tone you have in mind, and we’ll propose a few suitable options.

Also, if the table is still available, I’d love to know whether you might be open to discussing a price adjustment. I would be looking in the $9,000–$10,000 range and would be ready to proceed quickly.

Thank you for your message.

This lamp can absolutely be rewired for use in the USA. We generally recommend replacing the wiring and the plug, though the bulb fitting can usually remain the same. In this case, the rewiring should be a relatively straightforward job.

We always suggest having this work done by a local electrician or lamp specialist. Unfortunately, we’re unable to modify the wiring here in Europe, as—due to safety regulations—the lamp must be tested on the local electrical circuit before it can be used.

The price for this lamp is 5,500 EUR / apr. 6,430 USD.
Front door delivery including packing and custom crating is 500 EUR / 584 USD.
This excludes any import duties/taxes (if applicable) and unpacking/uncrating.
Estimated delivery time is 2-3 weeks from order confirmation onwards.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
Jan

Is it everything allright with the London delivery?
The reason I ask is because I have a UPS deadline by July 10th. That means that after that date they can return the goods to me if something goes wrong.

Hope you had a great 4th! I really appreciate your interest in this set. Unfortunately, less than half my retail price including shipping isn’t something I can work with. This is the only set available stateside and one of just two worldwide. If your client’s open to handling importing, shipping, and reupholstery themselves, they might be able to land somewhere around $8,500 with the other set in Italy-- though with all the logistics, it’s definitely a hands-on process.

That said, I’d love to see this go to a beautiful project of yours, so my absolute best price would be $9,500, about 35% off retail.

Just a note: shipping is always additional. I don’t make a profit on freight, my shippers are small businesses too, and we’re all supporting one another. For this set, the shipping cost would be $200.

Warmly,

Thank you for enquiring about this beautiful gold-lacquer writing box from the early 19th century. 
Below I write a more detailed description of the work and its trade price.
With best wishes for the holiday weekend,
Erik

Maki-e Gold-Lacquer artist
Box for Writing Utensils with Design of Egrets and Waterwheel, circa 1800
Maki-e gold lacquer on wood
Size 2¾ x 9½ x 7½ in. 

Of rounded rectilinear form with slightly domed kabusebuta (overhanging lid), of nando suzuribako type with a storage space for paper below and a kakego (tray) above, the exterior finished in gold nashiji flakes over a roiro black lacquer ground, the decoration in gold hiramaki-e and takamaki-e with a few details in black lacquer and some passages of dense gold kinpun, depicting a suisha or mizuguruma (waterwheel for irrigation), with four shirasagi (egrets) flying above in a formation that echoes the curve of the wheel, another egret below just taking to the air, their necks folded in a characteristic S-shape, the sides of the box with further egrets and the lower part of the wheel, the kakego with three more egrets, the river and reeds, the kakego fitted with a frame securing a suzuri (ink-grinding stone) and a copper suiteki (water dropper) in the form of a water-plant bud and leaves and with a fudekake (brush rest) to either side, the bases black lacquer with sparse gold hirame flakes; silvered metal cord fittings in the form of cherry blossoms

Comes with a wood fitted tomobako storage box inscribed Gunro suisha maki-e on-suzuribako (Box for Writing Utensils with Waterwheel and Egret Design in Maki-e)

Combining the motifs of a waterwheel and a flight of egrets, an anonymous master lacquerer here creates an original design with few recorded parallels in traditional Japanese art: compositions including a waterwheel, bridge, and willow had been a favorite subject for screen painting since the end of the sixteenth century but this pairing with egrets is rarely, if ever, seen in any medium. While the maki-e techniques used are conventional, the artist has deployed the elements of the design with a simplicity and boldness that recalls the Rinpa tradition, which was enjoying a revival when this box was made, probably during the late eighteenth / early nineteenth century.
